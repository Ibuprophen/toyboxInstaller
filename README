This is an Android installer for Rob Landley's toybox.

Design.
=======

My initial design thoughts are to download a recent binary of toybox
from Rob's web site that is suitable for what ever CPU we are running
on.

Then provide a list of the folders in the current PATH, so the user can
select where to install it.  Likely root will be needed, though I think
there are non root ways of running things like toybox.  I dunno yet if
access to the PATH is possible, or the CPU type.  We shall see.

A fall back option is to use some sort of directory picker.


About the logo.
===============

After some discussion on the mailing list about a suitable logo, Rob
mentioned that he would love to get the rights to use the image from -

http://www.dorodango.com/about.html

Bruce Gardner was gracious enough to give us the rights to use that
image for the toybox logo.  So the Placitas_Green_pillow.jpg image, and
all derivations of it, are used with permission from Bruce Gardner. 
Thank you Bruce.
